\section*{Abstract}
In the presentation, we will discuss immersed finite element (IFE) methods for solving the planer elasticity interface problems with Cartesian mesh. One important feature of these methods is that their partitions do not need to fit the material interface. The IFE functions are constructed to incorporate the interface jump conditions. Basic features of these IFE functions will be presented such as the unisolvent property. In particular, we will show that interpolations in these IFE spaces have the optimal approximation capability. Moreover, we will use numerical examples to demonstrate that IFE solutions based on the standard Galerkin formulation for elasticity interface problems also have the optimal convergence in both $L^2$ and $H^1$ norms.
