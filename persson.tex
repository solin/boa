\section*{Abstract}
The numerical simulation of flapping flight is a challenging problem, partly because of the large deformations of the computational domain, the transitional flows, and the complex geometries. We present our recent results with high-order accurate discontinuous Galerkin methods, which are capable of accurately solving complex flow problems on unstructured meshes \cite{1}. We generate tetrahedral meshes using the DistMesh mesh generator and the Delaunay refinement method. The elements are curved to align with the boundaries using a nonlinear elasticity analogy \cite{2}.

The moving domain is modeled by a mapping-based high-order accurate Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation \cite{3}. We explore various mappings, including explicitly prescribed expressions as well as numerical ones. The equations are discretized using the Compact DG method \cite{4}, and solved efficiently in parallel using Newton-Krylov solvers and optimized element ordering \cite{5}. We study several flapping strategies and flow parameters, and determine in which regimes a high-fidelity approach is required and when faster simulation tools could be used \cite{6}.
