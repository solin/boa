\section*{Abstract}
Hybrid FRP sheets can change the linear stress-strain characteristics of the single FRP up to failure and lack of yield plateau, which has a good impact on the overall ductility of the strengthened concrete columns. In this paper, interply Hybrid GFRP/CFRP was proposed to strengthen concrete columns, and the expression of interfacial shear stress of strengthened columns was derived by using theoretical model for analysis of the interfacial shear stress of concrete columns strengthened with interply Hybrid GFRP/CFRP, which agreed well with the analysis of the finite element modeling (FEM) method. The effects of modulus ratio of the Hybrid FRP and concrete as well as size ratio of the column and thickness of Hybrid FRP on the interfacial shear stress were also discussed, which will be helpful for the research n the interfacial mechanical behavior of structures strengthened with the Hybrid FRP.
