\section*{Abstract}
Trocar insertion, the first step to most micro surgery procedures is a difficult procedure to learn and practice because procedure is carried out almost entirely without any visual feedback of the organs underlying the tissue being punctured. A majority of injuries is attributed to the excessive use of force by the surgeon. Hence, the current research in Virtual reality lab is focused on simulating the trocar insertion procedure, in real time using advanced simulation techniques and develops a trocar insertion simulator for surgeon skill enhancement. In this paper, we present the results of our preliminary analysis of the problem, carried out using non linear FEM solver. The purpose of this analysis is to simulate the problem realistically with different material models of increasing complexity. The results of the analysis gives an idea about stress distribution pattern at the point of insertion, maximum stress developed in the vicinity of penetration and correlation between different trocar design factors and stress patterns in the vicinity of trocar insertion. We intend to use this information to construct a haptic simulator for surgeon skill training.
