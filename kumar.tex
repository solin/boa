\section*{Abstract}
This project deals with the usage of Independent Component Analysis for processing EEG signal. In this proposed project we have obtained EEG signal from a normal human subject and processed through five signal processing techniques which are signal acquisition, filtering, sub sampling, running ICA and signal extraction. As a result of this process we have obtained processed EEG data from which channels responsible for performing certain specified tasks done by the normal human subject while taking EEG can be obtained. This has been obtained by undergoing certain internal threshold operations based on ICA weightage of the processed EEG signal. This project can be extended for helping handicapped people by implementing artificial parts to their body based on their EEG signal generated. In this project we have used a specified tool kit to perform EEG based operations called as “EEG LAB tool kit” which is a toolbox that can be added to MATLAB.
