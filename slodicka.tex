\section*{Abstract}
 The motivation of heat assisted recording is to improve the thermal stability of recorded data bits by increasing the strength of the uniaxial anisotropy. During the recording process the medium is heated by a laser, reducing the coercivity and allowing the head to write data bits. We present a micromagnetic model based on the augmented Landau-Lifshitz equation taking into account a phenomenological power-law describing the dependence of the saturation magnetization on the temperature. A full-discrete numerical scheme is presented and the convergence of approximate solutions to a weak one is shown.
