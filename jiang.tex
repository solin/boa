\section*{Abstract}

Losing stability of surrounding rock is closely related to discontinuities during underground excavation. Aiming at the defects of numerical simulation methods for stability of surrounding rock with various discontinuity surfaces, the accuracy of FEM for contact problems to simulate discontinuities are pointed out. With FEM code for solving multibody contact problem developed by the authors, this paper mainly study the effect of different dip angles and geo-stress on stability of surrounding rock with parallel weak interlayer. Numerical analysis indicates that both the dip angles and geo-stress have a strong impact on distortion and stress redistribution of surrounding rock. The research results may provide theoretical reference for engineering practice.
